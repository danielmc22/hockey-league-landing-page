          The common interest that members of the Association share is to
          inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play.
          Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee
          whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary
          action regardless of technical hockey background, expertise,
          accomplishments or standing.
